## Radix Network Staking

An important feature of the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) is that users can “stake” [XRD tokens](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) to increase the security of the network, and be rewarded for doing so.

The process involves choosing one or more [validators](?glossaryAnchor=validators) to stake to, and then doing a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) to send some XRD to the network to support those validators. You can unstake the XRD later to get them back – and you’ll find that you accumulated extra XRD in the meantime.

The extra XRD you earn is proportional to how much XRD you stake, and is often called an “APY” (annual percentage yield).

You can stake, unstake, and check on your validators and APY returns using the [Radix Dashboard](?glossaryAnchor=dashboard) dApp.

Staking is a great way to put your XRD to work and earn a return, but it’s not simply free money. There are very important choices you need to make about the validators you choose, and how you monitor your stakes over time.
