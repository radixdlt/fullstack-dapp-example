## Radix Personas

Personas are the web3 replacement for the old email address and password login. Using a Persona of your choice, you can securely log in to [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) built on Radix without having to remember a password at all.

Using your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app, you can create as many Personas as you like. Personas can also hold pieces of your personal information - like name and email address - that dApps can request access to, if you want to give permission.
