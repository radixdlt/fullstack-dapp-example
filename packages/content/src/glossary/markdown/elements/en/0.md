## Elements

Elements are the simple currency token of RadQuest, fused together to generate random [RadGems](?glossaryAnchor=radgems) that can then be used to create RadMorphs.

Elements are usually obtained from Jettyâ€™s [gift boxes](?glossaryAnchor=giftboxes) that you will earn throughout RadQuest. The quantity of Elements you receive is random, but better gift boxes tend to produce greater quantities of Elements.
