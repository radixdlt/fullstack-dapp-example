## dApps

Decentralized applications, or dApps, are basically any application that makes use of web3 features.

In web3, users control their own digital assets and identity. That’s much different from typical webpages and other apps today. For example, to access your money, you have to do it through a banking or payments app. Your login to every website is owned by that website, or else you use something like your Google login, which is owned by Google.

But in web3, you can hold your money in an [account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that you control directly with a [wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app, and you can create your own [login](?glossaryAnchor=personas) in your wallet app and use that in many places.

Doing things that way is “decentralized” – and it means that websites and applications need to be built specially to interact with wallet apps, self-owned accounts, and self-owned logins. That’s what makes them dApps.

In the end, web3 dApps can do many things that were never possible before. For example, a [decentralized exchange](?glossaryAnchor=dex) dApp can let you instantly swap between two different kinds of assets right from your wallet in just a click.
