## Morph Energy Cards

Morph Energy Cards can be used up to harness the raw elemental forces of the universe to create beautiful [RadMorph](?glossaryAnchor=radmorphs) NFTs. Each defines a particular RadMorph shape that its energies can create, with some shapes being more rare than others. More rare Morph Energy Cards tend to have a higher quality rating out of a possible 50.

Morph Energy Cards can be obtained from Jettyâ€™s [gift boxes](?glossaryAnchor=giftboxes) that you will earn throughout RadQuest. The Card you get is random, but better gift boxes tend to produce more rare Cards.

Some Morph Energy Cards are even limited-edition; once their time is up, they will no longer be found in any gift box. This makes RadMorphs created from limited-edition Cards even more special.
