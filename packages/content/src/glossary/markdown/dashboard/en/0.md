## Radix Dashboard

The Radix Dashboard is a [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dappas) created by the same team as the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) to help users interact with the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) directly.

You can look up information about things on the Radix Network by entering its address, such as: Accounts, tokens, NFTs, components (smart contracts), and more.

You can also use the Radix Dashboardâ€™s [network staking](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking) feature to view the list of current Radix Network validators, stake XRD, and manage your existing network staking.
