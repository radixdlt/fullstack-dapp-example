## Bridging

Bridging is the process of getting assets into and out of the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork). Assets on Radix can be held by your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork), and used with [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) on Radix. There are a variety of dApp that provide bridging in different ways, for different assets.

Sometimes bridging involves converting an asset into a different form that can live on Radix. For example, dollars (USD) in your bank account might be bridged into Radix and become xUSDC tokens in your Radix Wallet. Or your Bitcoin (BTC) might be bridged into xwBTC tokens.

Sometimes bridging works as a swap, similar to a [DEX](?glossaryAnchor=dex). In this case you might swap one asset outside Radix for a different asset within Radix. Maybe you swap ETH (on the Ethereum network) for XRD tokens (on the Radix Network) at a current market price.
