## The Radix Network

Radix is an open network that makes [web3](?glossaryAnchor=web3) possible.  Think of the Radix Network as a public place on the internet where users can directly control their own digital assets, and where those assets can move effortlessly between users and applications – without relying on any company.

You can view and freely [transfer](?glossaryAnchor=transfers) your assets on the Radix Network using the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app. Applications built using the Radix Network’s capabilities (called [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) – like [RadQuest](?glossaryAnchor=radquest) – have the ability to interact with these assets and identities, letting you do things that weren't possible before on the web.

For example, all of the rewards that you earn on [RadQuest](?glossaryAnchor=radquest) are real Radix assets, which means that they aren’t stuck inside RadQuest. You’ll see them in your Radix Wallet and can transfer and trade them with others outside RadQuest.
