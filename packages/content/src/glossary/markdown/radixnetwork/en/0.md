## The Radix Network

Radix is an open network that makes it possible for users to have true ownership of their digital assets and identity without relying on any company or application.

You control your own Radix assets and identity using the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet). Applications built using Radix (called [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps)) – like [RadQuest](?glossaryAnchor=radquest) – have the ability to interact with these assets and identities, letting you do things that weren't possible before on the web.
