## Radix Accounts

Accounts are secure containers for any kind of digital asset on the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork).

Unlike an account on a bank or other service, there is no company that controls your Radix Accounts for you. Your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app on your phone gives you direct access to your Accounts on the network, and can help you regain access to your Accounts if you lose your phone.

Compared to accounts on other crypto networks, Radix Accounts are so much more clever, they’re sometimes called “Smart Accounts”.
