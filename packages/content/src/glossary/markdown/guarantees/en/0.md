## Deposit Guarantees

Some Radix [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) may have unpredictable results. In these cases, deposit guarantees make sure you never get less than you expect when you expect to get something back in a transaction.

For example, the result of a swap between assets using a [DEX](?glossaryAnchor=dex) depends on a current market price of the assets involved. You may see one price when considering the swap, but it typically changes by the time the network processes it. Deposit guarantees protect you by letting you specify a minimum amount that must be deposited to your account at the end of the swap transaction.

To make this possible, the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) app and [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) work together. The wallet will show you whenever a deposit to your account is "estimated" rather than of a known quantity. And whenever that's true, you can set your own "guarantees" in the wallet on those estimated deposits â€“ putting a limit on how much you expect to get for you to be willing to go through with the transaction. If that guarantee isn't met at the time the transaction is processed, the deal is off! The transaction is rejected by the Radix Network and no assets change hands.
