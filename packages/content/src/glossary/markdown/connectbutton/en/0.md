## √ Connect Button

[dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) built on Radix should always include a button marked **√ Connect**. Start here to connect your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) to the dApp.

In most cases, the √ Connect button will include a menu where you can Connect Now, often asking your Radix Wallet to log in with a Persona. After logging in, that menu should provide a variety of features and information to help you manage your login and sharing with that dApp.
