## Radix Network Validators

The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) is an open network that anybody can freely use. To make that possible, the network isn’t run by a company, but by an open community of “validators”.

Each validator is a server run by somebody that helps "validate" [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions). Working together, validators make sure that transactions are correctly processed and committed on the Radix Network.

When you [stake XRD tokens to the network](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking), you select validators that you trust to correctly and reliably keep running the Radix Network - it's a big responsibility, kind of like voting in an open election to pick good leaders.

Start with the link below to consider how you choose the validators that you stake to.
