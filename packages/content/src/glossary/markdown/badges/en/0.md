## Badges

[Tokens](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) and [NFTs](?glossaryAnchor=nfts) can represent almost anything. The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) makes it possible to use ownership of a token or NFT to authorize the holder to access to certain [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) functionality. Tokens or NFTs used in this way are referred to as “badges”, indicating that only the holder of the badge can use it for authorization.

When a badge is used to authorize access in a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions), you will see it listed in the [Radix Wallet’s](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) summary of the transaction under “presenting”. The badge isn’t being sent anywhere; all that’s happening is that you are providing proof that you own the badge.
