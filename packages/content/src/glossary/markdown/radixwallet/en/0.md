## Radix Wallet

The Radix Wallet is an iOS and Android mobile app that is your gateway to the capabilities of the Radix Network.

It helps you create and use [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that can hold all of your digital assets on Radix, and [Personas](?glossaryAnchor=personas) that you can use to securely log in to [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) built on Radix without a password.

The Radix Wallet also makes sure that you are always in control of [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) that interact with your Accounts and assets.

Think of the Radix Wallet as your companion as you move between dApps on Radix – keeping your assets safe, and letting you choose who you are and what you bring with you on each dApp.

The Radix Wallet was created by the team who created the Radix Network’s technology, and is offered for free (and open-source) to let anyone use Radix and dApps built on Radix.
