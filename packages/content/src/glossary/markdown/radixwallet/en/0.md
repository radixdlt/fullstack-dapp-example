## Radix Wallet

The Radix Wallet is an iOS and Android mobile app that is your gateway to the capabilities of the Radix Network.

It helps you create and use [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that can hold all of your digital assets on Radix, and [Personas](?glossaryAnchor=personas) that you can use to securely login to [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) built on Radix without a password.

The Radix Wallet also makes sure that you are always in control of [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) that interact with your Accounts and assets.

Think of the Radix Wallet as your companion as you move between dApps on Radix â€“ keeping your assets safe, and letting you choose who you are and what you bring with you on each dApp.
