## Gift Boxes

Gift boxes are Jetty’s way of rewarding your progress through RadQuest.

Inside each gift box can be found 1 [Morph Energy Card](?glossaryAnchor=cards) and a random quantity of [Elements](?glossaryAnchor=elements) tokens.

**Simple gift boxes** usually contain a common Card and a reasonable number of Elements.

**Fancy gift boxes** more frequently contain a rare Card… occasionally even an ultra-care one. They also have more Elements.

**Elite gift boxes** only contain a rare or ultra-rare card, and a generous quantity of Elements.

Because gift boxes are [tokens](?glossaryAnchor=tokens), they are yours to do with as you please! You can even re-gift a gift box to a friend if you want.

When you’re ready to open a gift box, Jetty can help you on RadQuest.
