RadGems are the simple raw materials used to create elaborate, collectible [RadMorph](?glossaryAnchor=radmorphs) NFTs. Each has a color and material, with some materials being more rare than others. More rare RadGems tend to have a higher quality rating out of a possible 25.

Jetty can help you create a RadGem from **5 [Elements](?glossaryAnchor=elements)**. The result is always mysterious and unknowable; you will get a random color, material, and quality every time.

The RadGems you own give you options for creating different RadMorphs of different appearance and quality. Will you hunt for your favorite colors, or settle for only RadGems of the utmost quality?
