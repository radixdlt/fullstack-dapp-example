## Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

A decentralized exchange, or “DEX” for short, is a [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) that offers something a bit like a much more powerful web3 version of a foreign currency exchange counter at the airport.

A DEX dApp lets users do instant and fully automated swaps between a huge variety of tokens or other digital assets. The exchange logic runs right on the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) itself. This means that a DEX swap is done with a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) and the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) can show you exactly what’s going to happen, and let you apply [deposit guarantees](?glossaryAnchor=guarantees) to the results.
