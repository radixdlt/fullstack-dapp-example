## Non-fungible Token (NFT)

Non-fungible tokens are a special class of web3 [token](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) where each token has a unique identity.

Like other tokens, they can represent many things. But NFTs are used to represent things where each is different from another, like pieces of art, loan positions, treasury bonds, tickets to assigned-seating events, collectible cards, or equipment in games.

The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) has special features specifically to make the creation and use of non-fungible tokens on Radix safe and predictable, and the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) can automatically provide useful information about the NFTs you hold in your [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts).
