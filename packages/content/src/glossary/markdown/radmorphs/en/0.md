## RadMorphs

RadMorphs are the ultimate reward of RadQuest. They are collectible and beautiful crystal formation NFTs – with _thousands_ of possible combinations of shape, colors, and materials, as well as differing rarity and quality.

Jetty can help you create a RadMorph from **2 simple [RadGems](?glossaryAnchor=radgems)** (defining the color and material) and **1 [Morph Energy Card](?glossaryAnchor=cards)** (defining the shape).

You choose what RadMorph you want to create from the raw materials that you’ve earned! The Card used will determine its final shape, and the colors of the RadGems will both be contained within. Using a RadGem of a more rare material will cause the RadMorph to also take on that material.

Different RadGems and Morph Energy Cards have different rarities. The more rare, the higher the possible “quality”. A RadMorph created from absolutely the highest possible quality materials can reach a quality of **100**. Can you create one so superb?
