## Token

Token is the general term for any kind of web3 asset that you can hold in a crypto wallet.

Tokens can represent many things, like dollars and euros, shares of companies, cryptocurrencies, or imaginary currencies in games. One special kind of token on Radix is [XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd).

The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) has special features specifically to make the creation and use of tokens on Radix safe and predictable, and the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) can automatically provide useful information about the tokens you hold in your [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts).

Usually “token” is used specifically to refer to assets that are all alike. For example, one XRD token is exactly the same as any other XRD token. Assets where each token has a unique identity have a special term: [a non-fungible token or NFT](?glossaryAnchor=nfts).
