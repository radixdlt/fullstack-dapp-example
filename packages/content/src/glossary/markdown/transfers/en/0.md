## Asset Transfers

The simplest kind of [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) on Radix is an asset transfer. It is simply a transaction to move a [token](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) or [NFT](?glossaryAnchor=nfts) from one [Account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) to another.

The [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) lets you do asset transfers from your own Accounts without using any other [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps). Simply go into the Account, tap the “Transfer” button, and fill in the recipient and the assets you want to transfer there. You can even choose multiple recipients and assets in a single asset transfer transaction.
