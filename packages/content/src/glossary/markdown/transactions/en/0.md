## Transactions

Any time a user or application wants to move assets around on the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork), they must sign and submit a transaction to the network to do it.

A transaction on Radix is basically a set of instructions to the network that might include things like "withdraw 10 XRD from my account" or "pass 2 RadGem NFTs to RadQuest".

Transactions can be very simple – like sending tokens to somebody – or can be complex, with lots of steps and interactions with dApps. But no matter what, any time a transaction touches your own assets, you will see and approve it in your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app first.
