## Transaction Fee

Each time a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) is submitted to the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork), a _very_ small fee (usually only a few cents) has to be paid to the network itself.

This fee must be paid in [XRD tokens](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) and is paid as a part of each transaction.

For transactions you submit to the network in your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet), you will see how much it will cost before you submit, and you can choose which [Account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) you want to pay the fee from.

Transactions fees on Radix are split into 3 parts.

**Network fees**: These support Radix [node operators](?glossaryAnchor=validators) who validate transactions and secure the Radix Network. The size of network fees reflect the burden each transaction puts on the network.

**Royalties**: These are set by developers who deploy code or run applications on the network. Royalties allow developers to collect a “use fee” every time their work is used as part of a transaction.

**Tips**: These are optional payments users can make directly to validators to prioritize their own transactions during periods of high network demand.
