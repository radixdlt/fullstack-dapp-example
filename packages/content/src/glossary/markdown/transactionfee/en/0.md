## Transaction Fee

Each time a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) is submitted to the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork), a _very_ small fee (usually only a few cents) has to be paid to the network itself.

This fee must be paid in [XRD tokens](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) and is paid as a part of each transaction. For transactions you submit to the network in your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet), you will see how much fee is to be paid before you submit, and you can choose which [Account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) you want to pay the fee from.
