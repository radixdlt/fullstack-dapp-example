## XRD Token

XRD is the official Radix Network token. It is created by the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) itself and users and applications can use it to use features of the network. For example, [transaction fees](?glossaryAnchor=transactionfee) are always paid in XRD, and XRD is the only token that can be used to participate in [Radix Network staking](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking).

Because XRD has a special role on Radix, XRD is also frequently used by [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) on Radix as a convenient form of money to pay for things and to enable exchanges with other tokens.
