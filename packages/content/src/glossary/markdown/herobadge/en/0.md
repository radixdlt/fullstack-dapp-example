## RadQuest Hero’s Badge

Your Hero’s Badge is a special [badge](?glossaryAnchor=badges) [NFT](?glossaryAnchor=nfts) used to identify you when you’re using RadQuest. Because you register a single [Account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) with RadQuest, your Hero’s Badge is held in that Account and cannot be [transferred](?glossaryAnchor=transfers) to anyone else.

You’ll notice that whenever you interact with RadQuest or Jetty, the [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) you review in your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) will show you “presenting” your RadQuest Hero’s Badge as proof that you are a true RadQuest user.

If you tap on your Hero’s Badge in your Radix Wallet, you’ll even see that it is imprinted with your progress on RadQuest as you go. Be proud of what you’ve accomplished, hero!
