Radix Wallet isn't only for holding stuff! You can securely login to dApps, like RadQuest, using your Radix Wallet with no password. You just click "connect", choose a Persona to use in your wallet, and you're done.

**Login to RadQuest now!**

- Click login in the "Connect" menu at the top of the screen. You'll see this on many Radix dApps
- In your wallet, create a Persona you want to use with RadQuest (or use an existing one if you made one already and prefer).
