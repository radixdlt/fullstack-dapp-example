_Did you look at the JettySwap transaction in your wallet?_

It showed you exactly what tokens were **leaving** and **coming back** to your Account.

**This is a unique feature of Radix.** It means that you don’t have to _trust_ the DEX website to tell you what you’ll get back in the swap. You can see it _directly_ in your own Radix Wallet.

> **Crypto expert note**: If you’ve ever used a different Web3 network like Ethereum, you know that this is pretty amazing. Other networks can’t give you this kind of control.
