**For example:**

Imagine a transaction has an **estimate** of a **5 XRD** deposit.

You set a **guarantee** of **4.8 XRD**.

When you submit the transaction, if the result is _anything less than **4.8 XRD**_ being deposited to your Account, the Radix Network **cancels the whole thing**. The transaction is rejected.

Anything more than **4.8 XRD** and the transaction goes through.
