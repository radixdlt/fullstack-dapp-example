**Try a swap on LettySwap:**

- Log in with your Radix Wallet at {lettySwapLink}.
- Again **choose the Account you registered with RadQuest!**
- Do a swap transaction, and pay attention to the **estimated** deposit and **guarantee**.

**The transaction might fail!**

That just means the Radix Network **protected you from getting less than your guarantee**. If your transaction fails, **try again until you complete a swap successfully**.

> Waiting for you to complete a swap on **JettySwap**â€¦
