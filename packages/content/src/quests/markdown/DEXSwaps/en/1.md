To use most crypto exchanges, you have to _trust the exchange to hold your tokens_.

The exchange could get hacked, and itâ€™s a hassle to move your tokens in and out.

Doing a swap on a **DEX**, however, is a **single step**.

In one [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions), you send the tokens to be swapped from your [account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts), and receive the result back to your account.

You never have to trust a company to hold your tokens for you.
