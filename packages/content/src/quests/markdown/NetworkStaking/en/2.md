## Radix Network Staking

You can put your XRD tokens to work by [staking](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking) them to the Radix Network itself.

When you stake, the network holds some of your XRD temporarily, helping make the network _more secure_.

In return, the network provides you with a **% yield in more XRD tokens** that you can withdraw later.

> This yield is often called an “APY” (annual percentage yield), because you earn more XRD as a _percentage_ of the amount of XRD that you stake.
