## Radix Network Staking

You can put your XRD tokens to work by “[staking](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking)” them to the Radix Network itself.

Basically, the network holds some of your XRD temporarily, helping make the network more secure. In return, the network provides you with a % return that you can withdraw later.
