## How to Stake

The easiest way to stake is to use the staking feature of the [Radix Dashboard](?glossaryAnchor=dashboard) dApp.

There, you can pick from a list of [network validators](?glossaryAnchor=validators) to stake to, choose how much XRD you want to stake, and do the stake in a transaction.
