## Radix Network Staking

When you [stake](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking) XRD, the Radix Network holds some of your XRD temporarily, helping make the network **more secure**.

In return, the network provides you with a **% yield in more XRD tokens** that you can withdraw later.

> **Tip:** This yield is often called an _APY_ (annual percentage yield), because you earn more XRD as a _percentage_ of the amount of XRD that you stake.
