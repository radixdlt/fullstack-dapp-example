**On the validator list on the Radix Dashboard:**

First **choose any validator by tapping its “SELECT” checkbox**.

Then at the top of the page, select **Stake to Selected**.

Enter **1 XRD** to stake to that validator, and then tap **Send to the Radix Wallet** to review and submit the staking transaction.

_As always, the Radix Wallet will show you exactly what’s going to happen in the transaction before you submit!_
