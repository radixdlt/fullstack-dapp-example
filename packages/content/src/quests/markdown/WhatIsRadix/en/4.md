## The Radix Network

You can think of the **Radix Network** as a special place on the web where anyone can have their own Radix [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that can safely hold _any kind of digital asset_ – from digital dollars to game equipment – and be connected to apps _anywhere_.

If a webpage or an app wants to interact with your Accounts and your stuff, it has to _request your permission_.

And when you log out of an app, you take your own stuff with you and can use it however you want.
