**The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) changes all that.** You can think of it as a special place on the web where you directly control Radix [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that can hold any kind of digital asset – from game assets to digital dollars – and be connected to apps anywhere.

If a webpage or an app wants to interact with the stuff you own, it has to _request your permission_.

And when you log out of an app, you take your own stuff with you and can use it however you want.
