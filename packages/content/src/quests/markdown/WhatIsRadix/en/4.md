## The Radix Network

You can think of the **[Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork)** as a public place on the web where anyone can have their own [Radix Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts).

Those Radix Accounts can safely hold _any kind of digital asset_ â€“ from digital dollars, to game equipment, to _thousands_ of other things that have value.
