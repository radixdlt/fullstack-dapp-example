## The Radix Network

You can think of the **[Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork)** as a public place on the web where anyone can have their own Radix [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that can safely hold _any kind of digital asset_ â€“ from digital dollars to game equipment.

Those Accounts can be connected to webpages or apps anywhere, but the apps must always _request your permission_.

And when you log out of an app, you _keep your own stuff with you_ and can use it however you want.
