Radix Accounts can be **connected** to webpages and apps that **run on Radix** (like [RadQuest](?glossaryAnchor=radquest)).

You never give up control of your Accounts. You just give _permission_ for the app to propose _useful things_ to do with the assets in them.

Using digital assets is what [web3](?glossaryAnchor=web3) is all about, and web3 websites and apps have a special name: [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps).
