Radix Accounts can be connected to special webpages and apps that **run on Radix** (like [RadQuest](?glossaryAnchor=radquest)).

You never give up control of your Accounts when you connect them to apps. You just give _permission_ for the app to propose useful things to do with the assets in them.

**Using digital assets is what [web3](?glossaryAnchor=web3) is all about**, and web3 websites and apps have a special name: [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps).
