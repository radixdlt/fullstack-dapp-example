## Intro to dApps

The Radix Network provides the foundations for a new type of internet. But with those foundations in place, what are we going to build on them?

The answer is decentralized applications, or [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dApps) as they’re usually known. On the face of it, they work in the same way as normal applications – think Facebook, Telegram or Spotify.

But these organizations store users’ data and can hold it, share it and use it for profit. With dApps, users’ anonymous data is held in nodes located across the globe. So there no companies, storing your data in their centralized servers, that can use or sell your personal information to make money.
