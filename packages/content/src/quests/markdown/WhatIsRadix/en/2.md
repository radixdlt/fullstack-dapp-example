**How Radix is creating a radically better financial system**

Very few people disagree with the idea that everyone should control their own money and have access to it without the need for expensive intermediaries like banks and financial institutions.

So why has it not been done yet?

Because until now, the technology has not existed. Early blockchains were great proofs of concept but they couldn’t cope with our world’s ever-increasing demands.

Radix solves this problem, with a platform that enables users to confidently engage with Web3 and gives builders the tools to intuitively create great products.
