_What is Radix?_

**If you’re already familiar with Web3 and DeFi, here’s the summary:** Radix is an all-new L-1 network designed from the ground up for Web3 and DeFi. It’s like Ethereum, but generations beyond in what it can do, and much easier and safer to use.

Using Radix dApps and the Radix Wallet will be a little different from what you’re used to… but you’ll see how it’s fixing the huge problems that hold back Web3 and DeFi today on other networks.
