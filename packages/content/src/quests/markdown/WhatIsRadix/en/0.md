## What is Radix?

> **For crypto-experienced folks**, here’s a quick breakdown:

Radix is an all-new **decentralized layer-1 network** designed from the ground up for web3 and DeFi. The concept is similar to Ethereum, but everything about Radix is _far more advanced_ in what it can do and how much **safer** and **easier** it is to use..

If you’re coming from **Metamask**, using **Radix dApps** and the **Radix Wallet** will be _different_ from what you’re used to. But _breaking the crypto mold_ was the only way to solve the huge problems that hold back web3 and DeFi today on other networks.
