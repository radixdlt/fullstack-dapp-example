## What is Radix?

> **For crypto-experienced folks**, here’s a quick breakdown:

Radix is an all-new **decentralized layer-1 network** designed from the ground up for web3 and DeFi. The concept is similar to Ethereum, but everything about Radix is _far more advanced_ in what it can do and how much **safer** and **easier** it is to use..

If you’re used to **MetaMask**, using the **Radix Wallet** and **Radix dApps** will be _different_ from what you’re used to.

But _breaking away from today’s crypto expectations_ was the only way to solve the _huge problems_ that hold back web3 and DeFi today on other networks.
