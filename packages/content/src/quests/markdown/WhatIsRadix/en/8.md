Basically, the idea of “Web3” is that we can now have webpages and other apps that have these digital asset super powers when you connect your Radix Wallet to them. This next generation of webpages and apps are called “[dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapp)”.

In fact, RadQuest itself is a dApp on Radix – you’re using one already!
