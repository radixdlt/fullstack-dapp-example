**Radix is _radically better_**

You’ve probably heard about blockchains by now. But you might not know how Radix has rethought, redesigned and recreated blockchain technology to put users' experience at the center.

As you’ve already read, the Radix Network is a fully integrated technology stack. Radix was built as a single ecosystem so it all fits together and users don’t encounter frustrating friction

Another important thing you absolutely need to know is that Radix is built for security. Until now, making transactions with a Web3 wallet has been a traumatic experience. Most users don’t know exactly what they’re signing and never have complete confidence that they’ll receive what they paid for.

When you sign a transaction on Radix, you’ll always know exactly what you’re sending and who you’re sending it to. And with deposit guarantees you can put super secure guardrails in place to make sure you get what is yours.
