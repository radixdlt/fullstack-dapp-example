The Radix Wallet lets you easily do [transfers](?glossaryAnchor=transfers) of your own assets.

It’s like sending money using a banking or payments app – but on Radix, transfers are instant, virtually free, and can be done to _anybody with a Radix Wallet_.

And you can transfer _any kind of asset_, even if it originally came from a [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapp).
