**The Radix transaction manifest**

The cool thing about transfers, compared to other transactions, is that you get to send things to other people and receive things yourself!

And with Radix, unlike on other blockchains and with other wallets, you’ll always know exactly what you’re sending and what you’re receiving. This is thanks to the [transaction manifest](?glossaryAnchor=transactionmanifest).

Radix was designed from the beginning to make transactions readable by humans. So there’s no blind signing, none of your assets mysteriously draining away and no unknown tokens turning up in your accounts.
