You’ve made it! You’ve completed the start of RadQuest! Pat yourself on the back and bask in the glory of what you’ve achieved.

You now have pretty much everything you need to go out into the wild and interact with the Radix Network.

You have your own Radix wallet
You can send and receive assets
You know all about accounts and personas
You know how to log in to dApps and share your account address
And you have XRD! So you can pay for transactions

What’s next?

Well, you could go explore the Radix ecosystem and put your new skills to use. And you should also definitely keep an eye out for future quests where you can earn more items and XRD.

But before any of that, you should hop over to the fusing station and transform everything you’ve earned into something far more special. It’s time to create your Radmorph!
