In return for completing these quests, Jetty will grant you:

- **Elements**

        Common token. Fuse to create Radgems.

- **Clams**

        General tokens. Great for user testing and experimenting.

- **Morph Energy Cards**

        Special cards with unique energies. Combine with Radgems to create Radmorphs.

You can earn and trade these itmes before fusing them to craft rare [NFTs](?glossaryAnchor=NFT).

INSERT IMAGE OF RADMORPH

The image above is a Radmorph. When the time comes, you'll create your very own to hold in your wallet, along with some [XRD](?glossaryAnchor=XRD) we'll be giving you (more on that later!).
