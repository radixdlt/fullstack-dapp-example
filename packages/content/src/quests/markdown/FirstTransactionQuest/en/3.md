All transactions on Radix require a very [small fee](?glossaryAnchor=fee), which is always paid in the native token of the Radix Network. You probably already know about this token. Itâ€™s called XRD.

Here are some of the things you can do with it.

- Pay for things in Radix dApps.
- [Stake](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking) it on the Radix Network.
- Send value to other Radix users.

XRD is the oil that lubricates the Radix ecosystem. Without it, there wouldn't be much decentralization and there'd be even less security.
