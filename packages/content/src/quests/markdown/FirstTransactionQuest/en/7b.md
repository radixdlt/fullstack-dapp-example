First, we’re going to airdrop you a special NFT – a RadQuest Hero’s Badge. RadQuest will check this badge whenever you claim rewards.

It’s an automatic check, so you won’t need to do anything, but it’s how the RadQuest dApp makes sure you’re authorized to receive rewards.

Think of it like an ID card, a cinema ticket or a subscription pass to a service. You can use badges to prove who you are and show dApps you’re authorized to do something or receive something.
