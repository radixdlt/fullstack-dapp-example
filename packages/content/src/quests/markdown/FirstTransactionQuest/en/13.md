Whenever you submit a transaction to the Radix Network, you have to pay a [network fee](?glossaryAnchor=networkfee) to help pay for the network.

The fee is almost always tiny, but it’s what makes the Radix Network work!

Network fees are always paid in a special official Radix Network token called “[XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd)”.
