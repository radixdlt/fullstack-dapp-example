Claiming your rewards is done with a transaction. dApps like RadQuest can propose transactions to your Radix Wallet.

When that happens, you’ll open your Radix Wallet and see the proposed transaction appear with a nice summary. That summary will always tell you what’s going to happen in the transactions; this is one of the unique features of the Radix Network that you don’t get on other crypto networks.

If you’re satisfied with what’s going to happen, you’ll sign and submit the transaction, and everything is okay, the Radix Network will process it.
