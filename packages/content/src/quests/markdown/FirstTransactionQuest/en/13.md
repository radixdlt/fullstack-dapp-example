You're about to claim your rewards with a transaction. dApps like RadQuest can propose transactions to your Radix Wallet – once you go into your wallet, you'll get a summary of what's included in the transaction.

As unusual as this sounds, seeing the details of a transaction you're about to sign is a feature unique to the Radix Network. Other blockchains and wallets expect you to blind sign without knowing exactly what it is you're signing.

Part of our mission to make finance _radically better_ is to guarantee our users have all the information they need.
