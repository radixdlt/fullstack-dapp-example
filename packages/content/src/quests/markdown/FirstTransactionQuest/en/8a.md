Your Hero Badge and XRD are on their way! It looks like your settings allow for all [external deposits](?glossaryAnchor=Deposit) into your account, so if you check your wallet now, you should see your badge and XRD in there.

You can adjust your external deposit settings to control who can and _cannot_ put tokens, NFTs or any other assets into your account. If your settings do **not** allow direct deposits, you can still confirm them individually, within the wallet.
