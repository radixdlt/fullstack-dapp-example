Your Hero Badge and XRD are on their way! It looks like your settings allow for all external deposits into your account, so if you check your wallet now, you should see your badge and XRD.

**FYI, you can adjust your external deposit settings to control who can and _cannot_ put tokens, NFTs or any other assets into your account.**

For future reference, if you’ve configured your account to **not** allow direct deposits, any dApps that want to send you something will need to request to make a deposit. You’ll need to open your wallet and OK the transaction.
