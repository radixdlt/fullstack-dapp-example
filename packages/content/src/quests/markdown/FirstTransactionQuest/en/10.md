## Transactions

[Transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) are how assets move from place to place on the Radix Network.

Theyâ€™re basically just instructions to the Radix Network telling it _what you want to happen_, step by step, kind of like this:

- Claim some tokens from RadQuest
- Deposit those tokens to my account

> **Another note for the crypto experts:** Transactions on Radix are quite different from those on other L-1 networks, offering much more flexibility and safety. [Click here to read more about it](https://www.radixdlt.com/blog/radixs-asset-oriented-transactions).
