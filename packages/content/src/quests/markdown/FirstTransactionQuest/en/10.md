You’re about to claim the rewards you’ve earned to this point. Jetty will transfer them to you and you’ll actually hold them in your Radix Wallet.

This is what makes Web3 different to Web 2.0.

Web 2.0 was the application layer of the internet – it made interacting directly with websites easy.

With Web3, you can own digital assets that have real-world value. You can sell, swap, send and receive assets. And blockchain technology keeps a secure record of every single transaction.

For example, take the rewards you’ve earned in RadQuest. They’re not just pretend assets that exist in the RadQuest game. You own them and can do whatever you want with them.
