For example:

Imagine a transaction has an estimate of a **5 XRD** deposit.

You set a guarantee of **4.8 XRD**.

If anything less than **4.8 XRD** would be deposited when the transaction is processed, the Radix Network cancels the whole thing â€“ the transaction is rejected.

Anything more than **4.8 XRD** and the transaction goes through!
