**Let’s learn a bit about DEXes!**

DEX stands for "Decentralized exchanges". Basically think about the FOREX currency exchange counter at the airport – but fully automated and able to work with virtually any kind of asset.

Decentralized exchanges make use of Radar's digital asset features to run the exchange logic right on the network so you can always see in your Radar Wallet what's going to happen. DEXes are also powerful because the "pools" of assets that the DEX system trades out of are provided not by a bank or company but individual users that can share in the fees that a DEX may collect from users.
