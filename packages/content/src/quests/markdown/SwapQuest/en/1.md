Typically to use an exchange service, you have to deposit tokens, do your trades, and then withdraw tokens later. You have to trust the exchange to hold your tokens safely, and it’s a bit annoying to use.

Doing a swap on a DEX, however, is a single step. In one [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions), you provide the tokens to be swapped and receive the result back. You never have to trust any “centralized” company to hold your tokens.
