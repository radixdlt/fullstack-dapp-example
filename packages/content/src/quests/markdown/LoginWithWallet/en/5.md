**Logging in with your Radix wallet**

Whatever device you’re using to interact with the Radix ecosystem – mobile or desktop – the process for logging in to dApps is very similar.

First, you’ll need to locate the Connect button in the top right of the screen.

Once you’ve clicked it, a login request will get sent to your wallet. Once this is done, you’ll need to open your Radix wallet to approve the request.

Once approved, you’re in!
