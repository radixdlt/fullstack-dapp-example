That’s it, you’re in! The ignition sequence has started and all engines are go. You’re connected to the Radix ecosystem!

You’ll notice the Connect button in the top right corner has changed. It now shows the persona you’re logged in as and the label you’ve given that persona.

When you create any future personas, you can label them whatever you want. You can use your real name, a made-up name, or even call yourself Jetty!
