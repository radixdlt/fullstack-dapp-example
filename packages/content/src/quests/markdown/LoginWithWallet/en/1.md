## **Personas**

We created [personas](?glossaryAnchor=Persona) to give users complete control over their data.

You choose what information you put into your persona, whether it's name, email address, phone number or more. Then with that persona, you can log in to Radix dApps, sharing only the information you've chosen.

No passwords needed and no showing everyone what's in your accounts.
