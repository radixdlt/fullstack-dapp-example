Before you log in to RadQuest with your Radix wallet, it will be useful to learn about [personas](?glossaryAnchor=Persona). Personas are your way of logging in to Radix dApps without passwords and without showing them what’s in your accounts.

Personas also give you control over what personal data you share with each specific platform. So if it’s gaming you’re into, you might want to share just your gaming alias. But if you need to prove your identity to a DeFi dApp, you might need to tell them a bit more.

Personas are there to give _you_ control.
