The official Radix Wallet download page will help you download and set up your wallet â€“ and also install the [Radix Connector browser extension](?glossaryAnchor=radixconnector).

Currently only the **Chrome** browser is officially supported for desktop use.

> Another option: Load up RadQuest in _any_ browser on your mobile phone to use it without any need for a browser extension.
