![Logging in with a Persona](/quests-images/key/2-KeyImage_PersonaLogin.webp)

When a [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) website needs you to log in, a request will pop up **in your Radix Wallet app**.

After you choose a [Persona](?glossaryAnchor=personas) you want to use on that dApp, the Radix Wallet will log you in instantly - _no password needed_.

Create as many Personas as you like, itâ€™s up to you!
