Nicely done! You did your **first transaction** using your Radix Wallet!

The dApp will **propose** a transaction, you’ll **review** it, and then **sign** it (at least if everything looks how you expect!)

**In the next quest**, I’ll show you how to crack open your **Gift Box** to see what’s inside – and you’ll learn how you can start creating your own collectible **RadMorph NFTs**!
