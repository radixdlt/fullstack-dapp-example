When dApps want to interact with _your Accounts_,  they **propose transactions** for your approval in the Radix Wallet.

**You’ll always have the chance to review transactions in your Radix Wallet**. If you’re satisfied a transaction does what you want, you can sign and submit it to the Radix Network to be processed.
