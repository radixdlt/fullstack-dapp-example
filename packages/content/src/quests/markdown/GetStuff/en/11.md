![Approving a Transaction in the Radix Wallet](/quests-images/key/3-KeyImage_ApprovingTransactions.webp)

Because you own your own Accounts and assets on Radix, when dApps want to interact with them, they _propose_ transactions for your approval in the Radix Wallet.

**Youâ€™ll always have the chance to review transactions in your Radix Wallet**, to make sure they match what you want before you submit them to the Radix Network to be processed.
