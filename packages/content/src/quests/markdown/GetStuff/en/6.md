## The XRD Token

[XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) is the oil that lubricates the Radix Network and dApps. It has _real-world value_, so in addition to paying transaction fees, XRD can be used to:

* [Stake](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking) to the Radix network and earn an [APY](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking).
* Send value to other Radix users.
* Participate in financial dApps on Radix.

> Youâ€™ll learn more about this stuff in later quests on RadQuest.
