## Transactions

[Transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) are how assets move from place to place on the Radix Network.

Theyâ€™re basically _instructions to the Radix Network_ telling it what you want to happen, step by step.

For example, a transaction might include steps like this:

1. Claim some tokens from RadQuest.
2. Deposit those tokens to my Account.

> **A note for the crypto experts:** Transactions on Radix are _very different_ from those on other Layer-1 networks, offering much more flexibility and safety. [Tap here for more about Radix transactions on the Radix blog](https://www.radixdlt.com/blog/radixs-asset-oriented-transactions).
