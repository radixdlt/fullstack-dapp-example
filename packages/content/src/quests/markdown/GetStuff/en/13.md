## Transaction Fees

Whenever you submit a transaction to the Radix Network, you have to pay a [transaction fee](?glossaryAnchor=transactionfee) to help pay for the network.

The fee is almost always _just a few cents worth_ in XRD, but itâ€™s what makes the Radix Network work!

Transaction fees are always paid in a special official Radix Network [token](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) called [XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd).
