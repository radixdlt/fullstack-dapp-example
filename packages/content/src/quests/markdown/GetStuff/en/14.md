** ILLUSTRATION OF XRD **

## The XRD Token

[XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) is the oil that lubricates the Radix Network and dApps. It has real-world value, so in addition to paying transaction fees, XRD can be used to:

- [Stake](?glossaryAnchor=networkstaking) to the Radix network and earn an APY.
- Send value to other Radix users.
- Participate in financial dApps on Radix.

(Youâ€™ll learn more about this stuff in later quests on RadQuest.)
