## Morph Energy Cards

Each [Morph Energy Card](?glossaryAnchor=cards) captures an _elemental energy_ of nature. Some cards are more rare than others, and some are even limited edition!

You will use up one Energy Card when you create a RadMorph, using its energy to _morph_ 2 raw RadGems into a **unique shape** determined by the card.
