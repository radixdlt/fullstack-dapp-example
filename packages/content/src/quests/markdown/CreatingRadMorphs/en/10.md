## RadGems

[RadGems](?glossaryAnchor=radgems) are simple NFTs that come in a range of **colors** and **materials** – some materials more rare than others.

RadGems may be beautiful on their own, but really they’re just the raw materials that you can use to create **thousands** of different [RadMorph](?glossaryAnchor=radmorphs) NFTs.

The RadGems you use to create a RadMorph will determine its color and material - a mix of 2 different RadGems you will choose.
