## Creating RadGems

You’ll find **10 Elements** in your first **Gift Box** – **just enough to create 2 RadGems**!

If you want to give it a try, start by opening my menu in the lower right and select “Create RadGem”. Then do it a second time.

With **2 RadGems**, the only other thing you need to create a RadMorph is **1 Morph Energy Card**…
