## Bridging

[Bridging](?glossaryAnchor=bridging) is the web3 term for moving assets into or out of a web3 network, like the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork).

Maybe youâ€™ve got **Dollars** in your bank account, or **Bitcoin** in a crypto wallet. Somehow you want to get that value into Radix so you can hold it in your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet), and use it with [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) built on Radix.
