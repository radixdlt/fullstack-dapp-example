## THORSwap

**THORSwap** provides a kind of bridge called a **decentralized cross-chain exchange**.

It is similar to a [DEX](?glossaryAnchor=dex), except that you can swap crypto assets **outside Radix** _(like **BTC**, **ETH**, **DOGE**, and more)_ for assets **inside Radix** _(like [XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd), xUSDC, xwBTC, xETH, and more)_.

You can also swap from Radix out to other networks.
