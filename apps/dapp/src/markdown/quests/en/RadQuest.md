In RadQuest, youâ€™ll try a number of small tasks to learn the basics and some of more advanced features:

Set up your wallet
Log in to a dApp
Transactions
Swap
Bridge
Staking
Multi-factor security setup

Any time you want to move web3 assets around on the Radar Network, it has to submit a transaction to the network. 

You will see the transaction in your Radar wallet so you can read it, understand what it will do, and choose if you want to securely "sign" it.
