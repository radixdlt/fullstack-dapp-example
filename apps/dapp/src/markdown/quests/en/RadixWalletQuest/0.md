**What can the Radix Wallet do?**

The Radix Wallet is a mobile app that securely holds your web3 assets and identities on the Radar Network (but not other networks e.g. Ethereum).

You can use your wallet to log into dApps on the Radar Network and approve web3 transactions using your digital assets.
